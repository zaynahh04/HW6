/**
 * Class PriorityQueue<E,P>
 *
 * The class implements a priority queue utilizing a min heap. The underlying 
 * data structure that implements the heap is an array of type 'Node'. Each 
 * element's value and priority data types are defined using a class generic 
 * interface. 
 *
 * On instantiation of this class, the data types of 'E' and 'P' are specified. 
 * In this case, the type 'E' is the element's value data type, and 'P' is the 
 * priority value data type. The priority object specified needs to have a 
 * comparable operator implemented (if the default comparable operator will not
 * suffice); case in point, if using data type Integer, it has a pre-defined 
 * comparable operator. But, this class  allows for more sophisticated
 * priority comparisons (e.g., see below on aging discussions as we also 
 * discussed in class).
 *
 * To allow the application (aka, user of this class) to have very basic priority 
 * management, the class does provide a method, changePriority(), such that you 
 * can change a priority of an element already on the queue. The invoker will need 
 * to know the node's element to use this (aka, have a handle to it), which is 
 * returned from the method which adds the element to the queue. This is for very 
 * basic priority management. Additionally, the invoker can dequeue an element
 * no matter where it is on the queue before it gets processes (popped off), and
 * later, if desired, enqueue it with a higher and/or lower priority.
 *
 * A more sophisticated approach would be to implement a weighted priority scheme 
 * that optionally allows aging and/or fair scheduling techniques to ensure there 
 * is no starvation. This is simple to do with this class. It is accomplished, by 
 * specifying an object type for the priority that supports this capability, and 
 * has defined  an appropriate comparable operator.
 *
 * Public Methods:
 * ---------------
 *
 * int size()           - Returns the number of elements in the queue
 * boolean isEmpty()    - Returns true if this collection contains no elements.
 * void clear()         - Removes all of the elements from this priority queue.
 * Node peek()          - Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue, or
 *                        returns null if this queue is empty.
 * Node add(E,P)        - Inserts the specified element into this priority queue.
 * Node offer(E,P)      - Inserts the specified element into this priority queue.
 * Node remove()        - Retrieves and removes the head of this queue. This 
 *                        method differs from poll only in that it throws an 
 *                        exception if this queue is empty.
 * Node poll()          - Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or returns 
 *                        null if this queue is empty.
 * boolean contains(E)  - Returns true if element 'E' is in queue, else false.
 * ArrayList<E> toArray - returns an array consisting of the element values in the 
 *                        queue.
 * void printPriorityQueue - This method is for debugging purposes, it will print 
 *                        out the min heap
 *
 *
 * Additional methods: The type 'Node' is returned from several methods. It
 * acts as a handle to the queued object when it is on the priority queue. The
 * following methods are available on the object 'Node' when the object is still 
 * on the queue:
 *  - changePriority    - given a handle to a node, you can change its priority
 *  - remove            - given a handle to a node, you can remove it from the 
 *                        queue directly
