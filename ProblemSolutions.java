     * Priority Queue (PQ) Game
     *
     * PQ1 Problem Statement:
     * -----------------------
     *
     * You are given an array of integers of boulders where boulders[i] is the
     * weight of the ith boulder.
     *
     * We are playing a game with the boulders. On each turn, we choose the heaviest
     * two boulders and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two boulders have
     * weights x and y. The result of this smash is:
     *
     *    If x == y, both boulders are destroyed, and
     *    If x != y, the boulder of weight x is destroyed, and the boulder of
     *               weight y has new weight y - x.
     *
     * At the end of the game, there is at most one boulder left.
     *
     * Return the weight of the last remaining boulder. If there are no boulders
     * left, return 0.
     *
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: boulders = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
     * Output: 1
     * Explanation:
     * We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the list converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
     * we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the list converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
     * we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the list converts to [1,1,1] then,
     * we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the list converts to [1] then that's the
     * value of the last stone.
     *
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: boulders = [1]
     * Output: 1
     *
     *
     *
     * RECOMMENDED APPROACH
     *
     * Initializing Priority Queue in reverse order, so that it gives
     * max element at the top. Taking top Elements and performing the
     * given operations in the question as long as 2 or more boulders;
     * returning the 0 if queue is empty else return pq.peek().

    /**
     * Method showDuplicates
     *
     * This method identifies duplicate strings in an array list. The list
     * is passed as an ArrayList<String> and the method returns an ArrayList<String>
     * containing only unique strings that appear more than once in the input list.
     * This returned array list is returned in sorted ascending order. Note that
     * this method should consider case (strings are case-sensitive).
     *
     * For example, if the input list was: "Lion", "Dog", "Cat", "Dog", "Horse", "Lion", "CAT"
     * the method would return an ArrayList<String> containing: "Dog", "Lion"
     *
     * @param  input an ArrayList<String>
     * @return       an ArrayList<String> containing only unique strings that appear
     *               more than once in the input list. They will be in ascending order.

     * Finds pairs in the input array that add up to k.
     *
     * @param input   Array of integers
     * @param k       The sum to find pairs for

     * @return an ArrayList<String> containing a list of strings. The ArrayList
     *        of strings needs to be ordered both within a pair, and
     *        between pairs in ascending order. E.g.,
     *
     *         - Ordering within a pair:
     *            A string is a pair in the format "(a, b)", where a and b are
     *            ordered lowest to highest, e.g., if a pair was the numbers
     *            6 and 3, then the string would be "(3, 6)", and NOT "(6, 3)".
     *         - Ordering between pairs:
     *            The ordering of strings of pairs should be sorted in lowest to
     *            highest pairs. E.g., if the following two string pairs within
     *            the returned ArraryList, "(3, 6)" and "(2, 7), they should be
     *            ordered in the ArrayList returned as "(2, 7)" and "(3, 6 )".
     *
     *         Example output:
     *         If the input array list was {2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, then the
     *         returned ArrayList<String> would be {"(2, 7)", "(3, 6)", "(4, 5)"}
     *
     *  HINT: Considering using any Java Collection Framework ADT that we have used
     *  to date, though HashSet. Consider using Java's "Collections.sort()" for final
     *  sort of ArrayList before returning so consistent answer. Utilize Oracle's
     *  Java Framework documentation in its use.
